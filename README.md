### Dataset Description
- Project 1: </br>
Corona - COVID19 virus affects the respiratory system of healthy individual & Chest X -Ray is one of the important imaging methods to identify the corona virus. With the Chest X - Ray dataset, Develop a Machine Learning Model to classify the X Rays of Healthy vs Pneumonia (Corona) affected patients & this model powers the AI application to test the Corona Virus in Faster Phase.

- Project 2: </br>
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the White House and a coalition of leading research groups have prepared the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). CORD-19 is a resource of over 128,000 scholarly articles, including over 59,000 with full text, about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related coronaviruses. This freely available dataset is provided to the global research community to apply recent advances in natural language processing and other AI techniques to generate new insights in support of the ongoing fight against this infectious disease. There is a growing urgency for these approaches because of the rapid acceleration in new coronavirus literature, making it difficult for the medical research community to keep up.
